Step for using the application :

1- Install java on your computer, this can be done with the link :
https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/#java21
I would recomment java 21.0.3 since that's the version I used to make the app.

2- Find the jar executable : 
The jar file is located in Jeopardy/out/artifacts/Jeopardy_jar/Jeopardy.jar

3- Create a shortcut (optionnal):
To make it easier to find I would recommend making a shortcut of the jar file an
put it on your desktop

you should now be able to run the app if you double click it
